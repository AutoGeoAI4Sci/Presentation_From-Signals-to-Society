## 🎤 Speakers & Topics

### 🧠 Hao Tian  
**Department of Geography**

**Talk:**  
*Can Seismic Signals Decode Human Behavior? Toward a Data-Driven Understanding of Human Dynamics*

This talk investigates whether passive seismic signals can serve as a proxy for human activity patterns. By leveraging signal analytics and data science pipelines, the research bridges physical sensing systems with behavioral inference models, opening new possibilities for urban monitoring and social analytics.

### 🌡 Yining Liu  
**Urban and Regional Science**

**Talk:**  
*Outdoor Thermal Comfort and Recreational Walking Thresholds Among Older Adults in Subsidized Housing: Insights from Strava*

This presentation integrates mobility data, environmental sensing, and human-centered analytics to evaluate how outdoor thermal conditions influence walking behavior among older adults. Using crowd-sourced movement data (e.g., Strava), the study contributes to climate adaptation, health equity, and urban resilience research.
